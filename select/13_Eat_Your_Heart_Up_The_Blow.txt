I came up near to you
My arm around your waist
Always wanted to get to know you,
To lean in and get a taste

I hear your heart beating

I found I wanted to eat your heart up,
Chew it up and swallow
And get your blood to flow
Through my head

A heart is like a savage
It's starving out and hiding low
It sees a chance and strikes
And drives its kill back underground to gorge

Oh-oh, oh, my heart
I've held you high off the ground
Baby, it's all in me
You wanna be let down
And you can walk around in the world
With me

Oh-oh, oh, my heart
What would we start? What would we do?
And what would people think if they saw me
Out with you?

Oh-oh, oh, my heart
What would we start? What would we do?
And what would people think if they saw me
Out with you?

Oh-oh, oh, my heart
What would we start? What would we do?
And what would people think if they saw me
Out with you?
