Limousines, oranges,
Stars, moons,
Submarines, Jeeps,
Glaciers, Cars,
Caterpillars, even grapes

Björk
It's none of my business
But you have to eat
Your appetite is appalling

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Have, have, have some salad

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Bite, bite, bite an apple

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Suck, suck, suck an orange

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Taste, taste, taste the pate

I'm just a maid, but yes to food is yes to life

Einar
I've got to eat something
Otherwise I'll just die
But the choice is too great
I can't decide what to eat
I'll possibly just eat the menu?

Björk
How would you like strawberry juice?
Or lemon red sea perch?

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Bite, bite, bite the kiwi

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Have, have, have some chicken

I'm just a maid, but yes to food is yes to life

Einar
The waiter came with the menu
And said here you go.
I said thank you but
The choice is too great,
Why can't I be a cod
In the depths of the ocean
And just eat small fish
The cod has such simple taste
But I've got all the choice

Björk
Bite, bite, bite an apple

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Limousines, oranges,
Stars, moons,
Submarines, Jeeps,
Glaciers, Cars,
Even Caterpillars.

Björk
Oh, you vague costomer
You'll have to look somewhere else
You have to find something to eat

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
No! eat eat, eat a moment

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Eat eat, eat the feeling

Einar
Eat eat eat the menu

Björk
Eat eat, eat the feeling,
Eat eat, eat the person,
Eat eat, eat the rockband

Einar
I won't complain but...
