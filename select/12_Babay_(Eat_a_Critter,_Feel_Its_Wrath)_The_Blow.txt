Babay, babay
Babay, babay
Babay, babay
Babay, babay

And I thank my lucky stars every day for indoor plumbing
'Cause I know nobody knows where I'd have ended up without it
Caught a bit of my fur in your teeth and you ate me
As I went sliding down your throat they heard my cry resound
I will always be around
I thought that I would always be around

Babay, babay
Babay, babay

But inside your digestive trip what was there for me to grip
I wanted nothing more than just to stay there
The truth is I was just too dumb to stop myself from holding on
I believed in love

The truth is I was just so dumb my mistook your refuse for love
Clinging in the bowels as the shits poured on
I might have stayed on but the gravity released me
And out, out I dropped, and now here I lay steaming

Babay, babay
Babay, babay
Babay
