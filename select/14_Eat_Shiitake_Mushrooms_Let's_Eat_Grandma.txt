And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)
And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

The water's contaminated with a peculiar illusion
Intoxicated with an electric infusion, intoxicate it
Let's have a chat to the music
We're syncopated cause I remember where to go
Getting in the zone
Move your body, and a hip a hip bone
And it was like yo
'Cause I've been living in a buttoned down world
Bottletop girl
Butterscotch flavour, covered in grazes
Come out with excuses that I bruise in the making
Carry on, crazy
Tripping on papers, bet I got bubblegum stuck to my trainers
Admit it, rarity for the flow, I hit a domino
I came a couple, couple times, decapitate my toe
It's now stuck in this crazed way

And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

And he was never invincible (On a shiitake grown island)
And he was never predictable (And he be rocking that boat)

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now

And he was never invincible
And he was never predictable

Shiitake mushroom, how do you grow?
Enchant me with your glow
You were covered in stone, but you made it now
